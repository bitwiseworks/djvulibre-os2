djvulibre for Debian
--------------------

Packaged with the cooperation of the upstream authors Yann LeCun and
Leon Bottou.

 WARNING: OTHERS MAY BE ABLE TO ACCESS FILES PROCESSED BY ANY2DJVU.
 The any2djvu program uploads files to a server for conversion,
 compression, and OCR.  Others (aside from the uploader) can
 theoretically access the compressed files.  This has been known to
 happen.

If someone else wants to take over this package I'm willing (eager) to
give it up.  Just ask.  (In fact, that goes for all my packages!)  If
someone does take it over, I'm happy to serve as an interface to the
upstream authors as I am in contact with them professionally anyway.

The Debian CVS repository is now shared with upstream.
 cvs -d :ext:UID@djvu.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/djvu checkout djvulibre-3.5
This makes the appropriate build command something like
 cvs-buildpackage -U debian_version_3_5_17-2 -M djvulibre-3.5 -F
