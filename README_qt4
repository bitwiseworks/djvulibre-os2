(NOT) BUILDING DJVIEW WITH QT4
==============================

The djview3 viewer distributed with 
djvulibre-3.5 does not support Qt4.
You need a recent version of Qt3 instead.

You can also compile djvulibre without this viewer.
The djview4 viewer based on Qt4 is distributed separately. 
To compile djview4. you must first install the 
djvulibre library and its header files.
